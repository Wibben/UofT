Bing Li

When I was doing the pipelining, I was trying to think of what needs to be passed onto the next
stage and what exactly marks the end of a stage. For this lab, by using the lab manual as a quide,
I have decided on the following stages:
Fetch 
	- Just sends PC to memory and increments PC
	- Control does pretty much nothing
Read 
	- Gets the instruction requested from the last cycle and splits it into opcode,Rx,Ry,Rx_data,Ry_data,imm8,imm11
	- Control still does pretty much nothing
Execute 
	- Select ALU input A and B and pass it through the ALU, passes through opcode,Rx,Ry,Rx_data,Ry_data for future
	- Control decides ALU inputs to select or to read from memory, also updates N and Z flags at the same time
Write
	- Write results to registers or memory
	- Control decides whether registers/pc/memory is being loaded
